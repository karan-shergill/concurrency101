# Concurrency & Multithreading
Java Concurrency and Multithreading Fundamentals

### 1. [Thread Creation](https://github.com/karan-shergill/concurrency101/blob/main/learning/src/main/java/learning/a_thread_creation/README.md)
Learn the fundamental ways to create and start threads in Java:
- Implementing Runnable interface
- Extending Thread class
- Using lambda expressions

### 2. [Thread Lifecycle](https://github.com/karan-shergill/concurrency101/blob/main/learning/src/main/java/learning/b_thread_lifecycle/README.md)
Understand the different states a thread can be in and transitions between them:
- NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, TERMINATED

### 3. [Monitor Lock (Synchronized)](https://github.com/karan-shergill/concurrency101/blob/main/learning/src/main/java/learning/c_monitor_lock/README.md)
Master Java's built-in synchronization mechanism:
- Synchronized methods and blocks
- Producer-Consumer patterns
- Wait/notify mechanisms

### 4. [Locks](https://github.com/karan-shergill/concurrency101/blob/main/learning/src/main/java/learning/d_locks/README.md)
Explore advanced locking mechanisms for fine-grained control:
- ReentrantLock
- ReadWriteLock
- StampedLock
- Semaphore

### 5. [Compare and Swap (Atomic Operations)](https://github.com/karan-shergill/concurrency101/blob/main/learning/src/main/java/learning/e_compare_and_swap/README.md)
Learn lock-free programming with atomic operations:
- AtomicInteger and other atomic classes
- Compare-and-swap operations

### 6. [Thread Pools](https://github.com/karan-shergill/concurrency101/blob/main/learning/src/main/java/learning/f_thread_pools/README.md)
Efficiently manage threads with thread pools:
- ThreadPoolExecutor
- Pool lifecycle management
- Practical usage patterns

### 7. [Future, Callable & CompletableFuture](https://github.com/karan-shergill/concurrency101/blob/main/learning/src/main/java/learning/g_future_callable_completable_future/README.md)
Handle asynchronous computations and results:
- Future interface
- Callable tasks
- CompletableFuture for async programming

### 8. [Executor Utility Class](https://github.com/karan-shergill/concurrency101/blob/main/learning/src/main/java/learning/h_executor_utility_class/README.md)
Utilize built-in executor services for common scenarios:
- FixedThreadPool
- CachedThreadPool
- SingleThreadExecutor
- ForkJoinPool
- WorkStealingPool

/*
UNDERSTANDING THE EXECUTION PATTERNS:

When you run this demo, you'll observe these patterns:

1. SYNCHRONIZED METHOD (task1):
   - Only ONE thread can execute task1() at a time
   - If Thread-1 is running task1(), Thread-2 and Thread-3 cannot call task1()
   - They must wait until Thread-1 finishes and releases the monitor lock

2. SYNCHRONIZED BLOCK (task2):
   - Before synchronized block: Can run concurrently
   - Inside synchronized block: Only one thread at a time
   - After synchronized block: Can run concurrently again

3. NON-SYNCHRONIZED METHOD (task3):
   - Multiple threads can run task3() simultaneously
   - No waiting required
   - Completely independent execution

KEY MONITOR LOCK RULES:

1. SAME OBJECT RULE:
   - Monitor lock is per-object (per instance)
   - If Thread-A has lock on obj1, Thread-B can still get lock on obj2
   - Different objects = different locks

2. LOCK GRANULARITY:
   - synchronized method = entire method protected
   - synchronized block = only that block protected

3. AUTOMATIC RELEASE:
   - Lock is automatically released when:
     * Method completes normally
     * Method throws an exception
     * synchronized block ends

4. DEADLOCK PREVENTION:
   - Always acquire locks in same order
   - Keep synchronized sections short
   - Avoid nested synchronization when possible

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
Think of monitor lock like a bathroom key:
- Only one person can use the bathroom at a time (synchronized method)
- They must wait in line if someone else has the key (blocked threads)
- Once done, they return the key for next person (lock released)
- Multiple bathrooms = multiple objects = multiple locks

PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS:
- Synchronization adds overhead
- Too much synchronization = bottleneck
- Too little synchronization = race conditions
- Balance is key for good performance

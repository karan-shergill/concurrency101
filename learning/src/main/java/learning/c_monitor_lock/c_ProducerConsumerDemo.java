/**
 * Producer-Consumer Pattern Demonstration
 * 
 * This example shows how multiple threads can safely coordinate using monitor locks.
 * The Producer-Consumer pattern is a classic multithreading scenario where:
 * - Producer threads generate data/items
 * - Consumer threads process data/items
 * - They share a common resource (like a buffer or queue)
 * 
 * WITHOUT synchronization: Race conditions, data corruption, unpredictable behavior
 * WITH synchronization: Safe, predictable, coordinated execution

/*
KEY LEARNING POINTS:

1. MONITOR LOCK BASICS:
   - 'synchronized' keyword creates a monitor lock on the object
   - Only ONE thread can hold the lock at a time
   - Other threads wait in queue for their turn

2. THREAD COORDINATION:
   - Producer and Consumer threads work with same shared resource
   - Synchronization prevents race conditions
   - Execution order becomes predictable

3. IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS:
   - Implement Runnable interface for thread tasks
   - Pass shared resources through constructors
   - Use lambda expressions as alternative to Runnable classes

4. REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
   - Web servers: Multiple requests accessing database
   - File processing: Multiple threads reading/writing files
   - Logging systems: Multiple threads writing to same log file
   - Shopping carts: Multiple users updating inventory

5. WITHOUT SYNCHRONIZATION PROBLEMS:
   - Race conditions (threads interfering with each other)
   - Data corruption (partial updates)
   - Inconsistent state (some operations succeed, others fail)
   - Unpredictable results (different outcomes each time)

Remember: When multiple threads access shared data, always use synchronization!
